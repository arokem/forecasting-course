# Ecological Dynamics & Forecasting Course

This is a course on how ecological systems change through time and how to forecast how they will change in the future.
It combines reading and discussing primary scientific literature with R tutorials on how to work with time-series data and make forecasts in R.
It is taught each Fall at the University of Florida by Drs. Morgan Ernest and Ethan White.
The full course including lecture notes and R tutorials is openly available so that students can learn these important approaches and skills for themselves and so that other teachers can reuse and remix the content of the course.
Anyone is welcome to use the material in their own courses and contributions are always welcome.
