## How to Contribute

* The course website is written in Hugo using the [Wowchemy Documentation theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-documentation-theme) and broader [Wowchemy system](https://wowchemy.com/)
* Most content is stored in one folder per lesson in the [`content/lessons` folder](https://github.com/weecology/forecasting-course/tree/main/content/lessons)
* To add a new lesson make a copy of the [lesson template folder](https://github.com/weecology/forecasting-course/tree/main/content/lessons/LessonTemplate) and modifying the pages in the resulting folder using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* Contributions of new lessons are welcome as Pull Requests or we can work with you to add new material and data to the site
* If you want to create a modified copy of the course including the website you should fork or copy the repository and [connect it to Netlify](https://wowchemy.com/docs/hugo-tutorials/deployment/) to automatically build the site
