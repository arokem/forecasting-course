## Introductions

* Instructors
* Goals for the class
    * Forecasting is increasingly important
	* Difficult
	* Ecology hasn't historically done this well
	* Need to study dynamics in order to understand this
	* Need to learn how to work with dynamic data
	* Learn from other fields dealing with similar problems
* Students
    * What do you hope to get out of the class

## How the course will run

* Mix of paper discussion & R tutorials
* Discussion
    * Read paper in advance
    * Questions to think about provided to help guide thinking while reading
    * Big group, so raise hands in Zoom
* R tutorials
    * Introductions to methods for working with dynamic data and forecasting
	* I do, we do, you do
	* We will demonstrate a concept, have you follow along on your computers,
      and then have you do something very similar in class
  * There will then be an assignment to do something very similar on your own
* Grades
  * 50% participation
	  * Participating in paper discussions in class
	  * Alternatively you can submit written answers to the discussion questions
  * 50% R tutorials
    * Follow along with R tutorials
    * Will include some sections for you to complete on your own
    * Turn in tutorial to Canvas

## Special notes for 2020

* This is going to be a hard semester for both learning & teaching
* We're all figuring out how to do this effectively online
* Most of us have more responsibilities & stress than usual
* We don't expect any of you to be operating at your full capacity

* We're trying to ensure that the course is manageable in this context
* Minimizing time committments - most weeks involve reading one paper and folowing along w/a 1 hour R Tutorial
* Not doing additional assignments beyond completing R tutorials
* Supporting asynchronous participation. The course is synchronous, but we're very sympathetic to the challenges that can pose since we currently have a kid going to school from home.
* If you can't participate asynchronously some weeks, or at all, you can read the papers and turn in written responses to the discussion questions instead of attendin class discussions.
* This group discussion is a valuable part of class, so it won't be as good of an experience, but that's OK.

## Questions about the course

* Any questions about how the course is going to work?


## Opening discussion

* What kinds of forecasts are you familiar with?
* What do these forecasts for us and our society?
* Do we think we can forecast successfully in ecology?
