### Types and properties of data for forecasting

* Start the analysis focused component of the course by talking about what kinds of data are available to be used for studying 
* Class Brainstorm: What properties would ideal data for studying ecological dynamics and making forecasts have?
    * Long time-series
    * Continuous
    * High resolution
    * Broad spatial replication
* Class Brainstorm: what types of data do we have for studying dynamics & making forecasts? Focus on general categories.
    * E.g., resurveys, idiosyncratic collection through time, continue time-series but the gaps, truly continuous time-seris
    * Talk about each type as it is brought up
    * Prompt for examples of each data type as it is brought up (if not already mentioned)
    * Write on the board in order from "further back in time/easier" to "more recent/more difficult"
        * Resurvey -> Idiosyncratic -> Continuous w/Gaps -> Continuous
        * Place purely spatial data off on one end the side with a "spatial only" label.
  
* Ask what types of data are easier/harder to collect
* Ask what types are more common for going further back in time vs. more recent
* (optionally) Draw these gradients on board

* How long do you think most ecological studies/time-series are?
* Show: Recent study by Estes et al. 2018

### Sources of ecological time-series data

* Brainstorm: Specific sources for ecological time-series data
* Bring over any sources from prior discussion and ask what the datasets in a group have in common
* As dataset for new group is suggested discuss the type of data and start a new column on board
    * Community science data
        * BBS
    * Compilations
        * GPDB
        * PBDB/Neotoma
        * BioTime
    * Long-term monitoring
        * NEON
        * LTERs
        * STRI Big Plots
        * Fisheries
    * Local studies

### Data for your research

* If you wanted to make a forecast for something you are interested in what do you think the most readily available type of data would be and do you know any specific examples?

### Where to find time-series data (optional; if students ask)

* Ecological Archives
* LTER Databank
* DataOne
* Ecological Data Wiki
* Google Data Search
