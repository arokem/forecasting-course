## Concepts

* How (generally) do species distribution models work?
* What is the distinction between environmental & geographic space?
* What is the distinction between using SDMs for explanation vs. interpolation vs. extrapolation

## Predictors

* How do we select predictors for SDMs (or other ecological models)?
* What should we do if we don't have measurements of our preferred variables?

## Modeling approaches

* What are some of the major categories of modeling approaches for SDMs and what
  are their characteristics?
* How do differences in these approaches relate to their use of explanation vs. prediction?
* How are presence only data dealt with when building models?

## Challenges

* Why do you think SDMs are so popular in attempts to forecast ecological change?
* What are the challenges for making SDM based forecasts?
* How might we determine how well these forecasts perform?

## Key Processes

* Should SDMs model the influence of other species and do they currently do this?
* What about other key biological processes like density dependence and dispersal?

## Uncertainty

* How is uncertainty addressed in SDMs and are there areas for improvement?

## Future

* What should be the next big steps in species distribution modeling?
