* What is the significance of species range shifts? 
* How does our knowledge of past climatic conditions (aka The Pleistocene) influence our interpretation of modern range shifts?  
* How are boundary changes vs non-boundary changes similar and different?  Do they influence species’ ecology in similar ways?  
* Parmesan et al. focuses on the role of climate in driving modern range shifts, but what other factors could/should be considered in analyzing the distributional changes of species?  
* How are latitudinal and altitudinal range shifts for boundary species similar and different?  How does a species’ movement up a mountain or closer to the poles influence its ecology? 
* Parmesan et al. found no obvious phylogenetic component in butterfly range shift patterns.  Are there other components that may influence the ability of butterflies to alter their distribution? 
* Butterflies are known to be sensitive to temperature.  How do we apply the results of this study to other taxa?
